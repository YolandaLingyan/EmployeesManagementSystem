# Employees Management System
This demo is a employees management system build by following official Angular 2 tutorial "TourOfHeroes".

## Run this project locally
```
npm install
npm start
```

### In this system, user can use the dashboard to:
  - check who're the outstanding employees this month;
    - search employee by name;
  - access all the employees information:
    - delete employee;
    - check someone's detail;
    - edit the employee's info (can only change the employee's name now)
  - edit the recruiting info.

### Something wait for implementation:
  - edit the details of employee (for example worktime, salary, positon);
  - add more search methods (use "search by name" now) like search by id, position, salary etc;
  - add content to the recruit branch
